<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>You add code to run by creating new controllers in your application's <code>Controllers/{{ $route }}</code> folder, and adding named methods there.</p>

<p>Add as many controllers and folders as you'd like; divide up functionality by job, feature, category; you name it.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
