<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>Sketchpad is an interactive front-end for your back-end; a place to write, test, experiment and execute code, or just a place to group useful tools and functions you want easy access to.</p>


<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>It shows the controllers and methods from your <code>Controllers{{ $route }}</code> folder, and allows you to run them without setting up routing, views, etc.</p>

<p>You can navigate to, and run any controller method, even modify parameter values, all from a friendly UI.</p>

<p>Install the gulp plugin to see updates to your code, live!</p>

<h3>Next steps...</h3>

<p>Navigate the menu on the left, or click <a title="New Controller" href="{{ $route }}:show/new">here</a> to add a new controller and methods.</p>
