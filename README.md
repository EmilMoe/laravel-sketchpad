# Laravel Sketchpad

## What it is

Sketchpad is an interactive front-end for your Laravel back-end; a place to write, test, experiment and execute code, or just a place to group useful tools and functions you want easy access to.

## What it does

It shows the controllers and methods from your `Controllers/sketchpad/` folder, and allows you to run them without setting up routing, views, etc.

You can navigate to, and run any controller method, even modify parameter values, all from a friendly UI.

Install the gulp plugin to see updates to your code, live!
