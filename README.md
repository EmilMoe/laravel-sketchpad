# Laravel Sketchpad

## Introduction

Sketchpad is an innovative, bolt-on development environment for your existing Laravel site.

It's a place to write, test, experiment and execute code, or just a place to group useful tools and functions you want easy access to.

## Overview

Sketchpad provides an alternative structure of controllers, views, assets and routing that lives alongside your main Laravel installation.

You can navigate methods, interactively modify parameters, and even [live-reload](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-reload) the code you're working on, all from a friendly UI.

Additional tooling and functionality is designed to make it quick and easy to develop or debug new tools, features and code.

## Uses

- Test out new coding ideas
- Develop tools and utilities for everyday work
- Debug applications in the same environment they're running in 
- Practice with new libraries or APIs with your existing code
- Give new hires a place to get up to speed with the codebase
- Double check how that rarely-used function actually works
- Give all that "secret" or commented-out code somewhere to live 
- Live-document existing features and tools
- Generate and manage reports
