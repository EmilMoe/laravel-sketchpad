# Laravel Sketchpad

## What it is

Sketchpad is an interactive front-end for your Laravel back-end; a place to write, test, experiment and execute code, or just a place to group useful tools and functions you want easy access to.

## What it does

It lists controllers and methods from folders of your choice, and allows you to run them without setting up routing, views, etc.

You can navigate to, and run any controller method, even modify parameter values, all from a friendly UI.

It comes with a whole bunch of useful tools and functions to make it easy to rattle out quick coding tests.

Install the [Sketchpad Reload](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-reload) plugin to see updates to your code, live!
