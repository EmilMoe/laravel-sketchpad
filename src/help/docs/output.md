### Overview

Sketchpad is designed to help you produce good-looking and meaningful output from the get-go.

It ships with a variety of helper functions and front end tricks to make it as *easy as possible* to put content on-screen.


### Helpers

The following helpers are loaded by default; you can use them in any methods loaded by Sketchpad:

| Helper    | Result
| --------- | -------
| `p()`     | Output paragraphs
| `pre()`   | Output preformatted text
| `code()`  | Output syntax-highlighted code
| `alert()` | Output Bootstrap alert elements
| `pr()`    | `print_r` data
| `vd()`    | `var_dump` data
| `dump()`  | `dd()` but don't die
| `json()`  | Output objects as JSON
