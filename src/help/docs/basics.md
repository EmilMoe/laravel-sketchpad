This section will teach you Sketchpad basics.

Remember:

- the UI mirrors your controllers and methods 1:1
- controllers are just **regular PHP classes**
- you can extend from Laravel Controllers if you need that functionality
- methods can echo or return output

Note that for **all** demo methods, you can simply look at the source code, available at:
