### Overview

Sketchpad is simple to learn, in fact there's only a few things you need to remember:

- the UI mirrors your controllers and methods 1:1
- controllers can be just **regular PHP classes**
- you may extend from Laravel Controllers if you need that functionality
- methods can echo or return output

This section covers the basics of writing, running and organising Sketchpad code.
