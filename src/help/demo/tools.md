### Overview

Sketchpad was designed for live-coding, but it's also a great place to store tools you'll run again and again.

The tools contained here are just examples of the types of things you can build and run with sketchpad, using features such as:

- Basic output, both `echo` and `return`
- HTML presentation using `p()`
- Data presentation with `tb()` and `ls()`
- Data dumping with `dump()` and `json()`
- Implicit pagination
- Implicit links
- VueJS components
- Blade views
- Sketchpad package view syntax `sketchpad::`
- View `$route` variable
- Markdown (this page!)
- Formatting
- Tags
