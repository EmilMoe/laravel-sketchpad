### Overview

This section covers the basics of writing, running and documenting code in Sketchpad.

All executable code is run through controller methods. Methods in Sketchpad are like methods in Laravel, only better:

- methods may return or simply echo output
- method parameters show as UI controls
- method parameters are automatically cast to the correct type
- you can test, or run your code by adding a special flag
- dependency injection works just the same
- exceptions are shown without breaking the page
- DocBlocks provide additional information for the front end
