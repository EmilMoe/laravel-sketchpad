For projects where you want control over the static content of a Sketchpad install, you can configure:

- the **site name**, which will update the site and page titles
- the [home page]({{route}}), using a custom Blade view
- the [help page]({{route}}help), using a custom Blade view
- whether to allow [search]({{route}}search) or [favourites]({{route}}favourites) pages

Configure site setup on the [settings]({{route}}settings#site) page.

If you choose custom home or help pages, edit their [files](pages) to suit your site.
