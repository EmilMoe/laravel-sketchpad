On installation, Sketchpad copies the following files to your [views](views) folder:

```text
help.blade.php
home.blade.php
```
They allow you to present different content depending on the install, so you could:

- differentiate different Sketchpad installs
- run Sketchpad as a standalone site with a custom home page
- provide site-specific help regarding your custom content


You can enable custom pages, or change the default folder, in the Site section of the [settings]({{route}}settings#site) page.
