For projects where you want control over the static content of a Sketchpad install, you can configure:

- the **site name**, which will update the navigation and document titles
- the **home page**, using a custom blade view
- the **help page**, using a custom blade view

This is in addition to:

- changing the look and feel of your site with [user assets](assets)
- hiding the settings page using [permissions](permissions)

Configure your site setup on the [Settings]({{route}}settings#site) page.
