Sketchpad allows you to inject custom head content via a custom [view](views) file:

```text
{{head}}
```


The initial HTML is as follows:

```html
{{html}}
```
Feel free to add or remove user assets, 3rd party libraries, add tracking, meta tags, etc. 

Note that the variables `assets` and `route` are available to use.
