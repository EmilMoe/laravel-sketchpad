Sketchpad provides a custom folder from which to load user assets:

```text
{{assets}}
```

Three starter files were copied here during installation:

```text
scripts.js
styles.css
favicon.ico
```

Feel free to modify, add or remove these files via your custom [head](head) file.

You might also want to check out:

- the settings [paths]({{route}}settings#paths) section to configure your asset path
- the [formatting](../output/formatting) example to view Sketchpad's default styles
- the [css tag](../tags/css) which can be used in conjunction with user assets to style the navigation element
