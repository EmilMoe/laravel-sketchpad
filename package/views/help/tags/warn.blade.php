<p>Hopefully the big red lozenge didn't put you off too much:</p>
<pre>@warn</pre>
<p>When the method is finally called, the deferred task, such as sending emails, will be run.</p>
<p>If you need to pass data to the deferred methods, your other options are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use <a href="../methods/parameters">method parameters</a> along with the warning</li>
	<li>Use <a href="../methods/test">test mode</a> for a more interactive way to test then run conditional code</li>
	<li>Use an <a href="../output/forms">HTML form</a>, which Sketchpad will intercept and submit back to the original method</li>
</ul>
