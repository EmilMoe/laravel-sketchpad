<h3>Hello there!</h3>
<p>This is an example controller, method and view, just to get you started:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the controller <code>ExampleController</code> is in your configured controllers folder</li>
    <li>the view is loaded from your configured views folder, using <code>view('sketchpad::example')</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to use views; you can just echo, but this demonstrates their use.</p>

<h3>Controllers</h3>
<p>You can edit, rename, replace or delete this controller and/or methods as you see fit.</p>
<p>However, you should begin to add controllers and methods so you can make proper use of Sketchpad and begin experimenting with code!</p>

<h3>Config</h3>
